## Exploring the Samples

### Setting up your preferred IDE

Using a modern Java IDE provides cool productivity features like auto-completion, on-the-fly compilation, assisted refactoring and debugging which can be useful when you're exploring the samples and even modifying the samples. Follow the steps below for your preferred IDE.

#### Using Eclipse

To generate Eclipse metadata (.classpath and .project files), do the following:

    ./gradlew eclipse

Once complete, you may then import the projects into Eclipse as usual:

 *File -> Import -> Existing projects into workspace*

Browse to the *'solace-samples-java'* root directory. All projects should import
free of errors.

#### Using IntelliJ IDEA

To generate IDEA metadata (.iml and .ipr files), do the following:

    ./gradlew idea
